## personas
1. Sarah, the Stressed Student (Age 16) Sarah is a 16-year-old high school student who feels overwhelmed by school and social pressures, leading to "low mood". She has a "low" technical skill level and wants a "calming", "minimalist" app that isn't confusing. She discovered the app on the app store while looking for a "Free" "digital diary". Her main goal is to use the "Activity Scheduler" to balance her "Necessary" homework with "Pleasurable" breaks and to use the "Mood Tracking" graph to see if her efforts are making a difference.

2. Mark, the Therapist Client (Age 45) Mark, 45, is "talking to a therapiest" to actively "treat depression". His therapist recommended the app as a digital version of the "Behavioural-Activation-booklet" they are working through. Mark has a "low" technical skill level and appreciates the simple, "user-friendly" design. His primary use case is to follow the steps his therapist outlined, using the "Digital Diary" to log activities, "rank" their difficulty, and use the "Activity Scheduler" to re-engage with his "Routine" life.

3. Chloe, the Self-Help Seeker (Age 29) Chloe, 29, has been experiencing a persistent "low mood" and has been trying "selfhelp from books and stuff". She found the app through "online articles" about mental health tools. She wants a "Free (at launch)" app that provides more structure than a simple notebook. She is most interested in the "Activity Library" for ideas on "Pleasurable" activities and the "Activity Ranking" feature, which lets her start with "Easiest" tasks when she feels unmotivated.
